# Evaluation-of-ML-Models-Against-DDoS-Attacks-in-SDN
This project evaluates the effectiveness of Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and k-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) machine learning algorithms in detecting SYN flood, ICMP flood, and UDP flood Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks within Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environments.
